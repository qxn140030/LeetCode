The gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit.
Given a non-negative integer n representing the total number of bits in the code, print the sequence of gray code. A gray
code sequence must begin with 0.
For example, given n = 2, return [0,1,3,2]. Its gray code sequence is:
00 - 0
01 - 1
11 - 3
10 - 2
Note: For a given n, a gray code sequence is not uniquely defined.
For example, [0,2,3,1] is also a valid gray code sequence according to the above definition.
For now, the judge is able to judge based on one instance of gray code sequence. Sorry about that.

Time complexity: O(2^n). Space complexity: O(2^n). 
public class Solution {
    public List<Integer> grayCode(int n) {
        List<Integer> rst = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        if (n < 0) {
            return rst;
        }
        rst.add(0);
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            int size = rst.size();
            for (int j = size - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
                rst.add((1 << (i - 1)) | rst.get(j));       // or (1 << (i - 1)) + rst.get(j)
            }
        }
        return rst;
    }
}
