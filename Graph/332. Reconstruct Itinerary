Given a list of airline tickets represented by pairs of departure and arrival airports [from, to], reconstruct the itinerary
in order. All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from JFK. Thus, the itinerary must begin with JFK.
Note:
If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary that has the smallest lexical order when read as a
single string. For example, the itinerary ["JFK", "LGA"] has a smaller lexical order than ["JFK", "LGB"].
All airports are represented by three capital letters (IATA code).
You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary.
Example 1:
tickets = [["MUC", "LHR"], ["JFK", "MUC"], ["SFO", "SJC"], ["LHR", "SFO"]]
Return ["JFK", "MUC", "LHR", "SFO", "SJC"].
Example 2:
tickets = [["JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"]]
Return ["JFK","ATL","JFK","SFO","ATL","SFO"].
Another possible reconstruction is ["JFK","SFO","ATL","JFK","ATL","SFO"]. But it is larger in lexical order.

Approach 1: DFS
Time complexity: O(nlogn)
Space complexity: O(n)

public List<String> findItinerary(List<List<String>> tickets) {
    List<String> rst = new ArrayList<>();
    Map<String, PriorityQueue<String>> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < tickets.size(); i++) {
        map.computeIfAbsent(tickets.get(i).get(0), k -> new PriorityQueue<String>()).offer(tickets.get(i).get(1));
    }
    dfs(map, rst, "JFK");
    Collections.reverse(rst);
    return rst;
}
void dfs(Map<String, PriorityQueue<String>> map, List<String> rst, String cur) {
    while (map.containsKey(cur) && !map.get(cur).isEmpty()) {
        dfs(map, rst, map.get(cur).poll());
    }
    rst.add(cur);
}
