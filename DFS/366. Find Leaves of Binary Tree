Given the root of a binary tree, collect a tree's nodes as if you were doing this:
Collect all the leaf nodes. Remove all the leaf nodes. Repeat until the tree is empty.
Example 1:    1
             / \
            2   3
           / \
          4   5
Output: [[4,5,3],[2],[1]] or [[3,5,4],[2],[1]] or [[3,4,5],[2],[1]]

Approach 1: DFS with sorting
Time complexity: O(
Space complexity: O(
