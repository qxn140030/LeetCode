Calculate the sum of two integers a and b, but you are not allowed to use the operator + and -.
Example: Given a = 1 and b = 2, return 3.

public class Solution {
    public int getSum(int a, int b) {
        int rst = 0;
        int carry = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++, a >>= 1, b >>= 1) {
            int low_a = (a & 1);
            int low_b = (b & 1);
            rst |= (low_a ^ low_b ^ carry) << i;
            carry = (low_a & low_b) | (low_a & carry) | (low_b & carry);
        }
        return rst;
    }
