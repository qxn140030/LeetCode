Question: Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. Do this without extra space.
          Could negative integers be palindromes? (ie, -1) NO!
          If you are thinking of converting the integer to string, note the restriction of using extra space.
          You could also try reversing an integer. However, if you have solved the problem "Reverse Integer", you know that the 
          reversed integer might overflow. How would you handle such case? There is a more generic way of solving this problem.

Time complexity: O(n). Space complexity: O(1).
public class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(int x) {
        if (x < 0) {
            return false;
        }
        int digit = 1;
        while (x / digit >= 10) {
            digit *= 10;
        }
        while (digit > 1) {
            if (x / digit != x % 10) {
                return false;
            }
            x = x % digit / 10;
            digit /= 100;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
