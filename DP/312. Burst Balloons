You are given n balloons, indexed from 0 to n - 1. Each balloon is painted with a number on it represented by an array nums. You are asked to burst all the balloons.
If you burst the ith balloon, you will get nums[i - 1] * nums[i] * nums[i + 1] coins. If i - 1 or i + 1 goes out of bounds of the array, then treat it as if there is a balloon with a 1 painted on it.
Return the maximum coins you can collect by bursting the balloons wisely.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,1,5,8]
Output: 167
Explanation:
nums = [3,1,5,8] --> [3,5,8] --> [3,8] --> [8] --> []
coins =  3*1*5    +   3*5*8   +  1*3*8  + 1*8*1 = 167

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,5]
Output: 10

public int maxCoins(int[] nums) {         // think which balloon to burst LAST in an interval
    int n = nums.length;
    int[] points = new int[n + 2];
    points[0] = 1;
    points[n + 1] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        points[i] = nums[i - 1];
    }
    int[][] dp = new int[n + 2][n + 2];    // dp[i][j]: max coins you can get from bursting ALL balloons in the open interval (i, j)
    for (int i = n; i >= 0; i--) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n + 2; j++) {
            for (int k = i + 1; k < j; k++) {
                dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k][j] + points[i] * points[j] * points[k]);
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[0][n + 1];      // dp[0][n + 1]: answer for the entire array
}
