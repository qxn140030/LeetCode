Given an integer n, return an array ans of length n + 1 such that for each i (0 <= i <= n), 
ans[i] is the number of 1's in the binary representation of i.

Example 1:
Input: n = 5
Output: [0,1,1,2,1,2]
Explanation:
0 --> 0
1 --> 1
2 --> 10
3 --> 11
4 --> 100
5 --> 101

Follow up:
- It's very easy to come up with a solution with a runtime of O(nlogn). Can you do it in linear time and possibly in a single pass?
- Can you do it without any built-in function?

Approach 1: Pop Count
