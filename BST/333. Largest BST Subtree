Given the root of a binary tree, find the largest subtree, which is also a Binary Search Tree (BST), 
where the largest means subtree has the largest number of nodes.
A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a tree in which all the nodes follow the below-mentioned properties:
- The left subtree values are less than the value of their parent (root) node's value.
- The right subtree values are greater than the value of their parent (root) node's value.
Note: 
A subtree must include all of its descendants.

Can you figure out ways to solve it with O(n) time complexity?
Example 1:
               10
              /  \
             5    15
            / \     \
           1   8     7
Input: root = [10,5,15,1,8,null,7]
Output: 3

Approach 1: Pre-Order Traversal
Time complexity: O(
Space complexity: O(
