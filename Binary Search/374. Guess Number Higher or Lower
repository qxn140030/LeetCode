We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.
You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three possible results:
-1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. num > pick).
1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. num < pick).
0: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. num == pick).
Return the number that I picked.

Example 1:
Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6

Example 2:
Input: n = 1, pick = 1
Output: 1

Example 3:
Input: n = 2, pick = 1
Output: 1

Approach 1: Brute Force
Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)

/** 
 * Forward declaration of guess API.
 * @param  num   your guess
 * @return 	     -1 if num is higher than the picked number
 *			      1 if num is lower than the picked number
 *               otherwise return 0
 * int guess(int num);

public class Solution extends GuessGame {
    public int guessNumber(int n) {
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (guess(i) == 0) {
                return i;
            }
        }
        return n;
    }
}

Approach 2: Binary Search
Time complexity: O(logn)
Space complexity: O(1)

public class Solution extends GuessGame {
    public int guessNumber(int n) {
        int start = 1, end = n;
        while (start + 1 < end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            int guess = guess(mid);
            if (guess < 0) {
                end = mid;
            } else {
                start = mid;
            }
        }
        return guess(start) == 0 ? start : end;
    }
}
