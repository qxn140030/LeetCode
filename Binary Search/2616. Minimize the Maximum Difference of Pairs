You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and an integer p. Find p pairs of indices of nums such that the maximum difference amongst all the pairs is minimized. 
Also, ensure no index appears more than once amongst the p pairs.
Note that for a pair of elements at the index i and j, the difference of this pair is |nums[i] - nums[j]|, where |x| represents the absolute value of x.
Return the minimum maximum difference among all p pairs. We define the maximum of an empty set to be zero.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [10,1,2,7,1,3], p = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: The first pair is formed from the indices 1 and 4, and the second pair is formed from the indices 2 and 5. 
The maximum difference is max(|nums[1] - nums[4]|, |nums[2] - nums[5]|) = max(0, 1) = 1. Therefore, we return 1.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [4,2,1,2], p = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: Let the indices 1 and 3 form a pair. The difference of that pair is |2 - 2| = 0, which is the minimum we can attain.

Approach 1: Greedy + Binary Search
Time complexity: O(nlog⁡V + nlog⁡n), where n is the size of nums and V be the maximum value in nums.
Space complexity: O(logn)

    public int minimizeMax(int[] nums, int p) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int n = nums.length;
        int left = 0, right = nums[n - 1] - nums[0];             // Range of the integer array.
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (countValidPairs(nums, mid) >= p) {               // If there are enough pairs, look for a smaller threshold.
                right = mid;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;                                  // Otherwise, look for a larger threshold.
            }
        }
        return left;
    }
    private int countValidPairs(int[] nums, int threshold) {     // Find the number of valid pairs by greedy approach.
        int index = 0, count = 0;
        while (index < nums.length - 1) {
            if (nums[index + 1] - nums[index] <= threshold) {
                count++;
                index++;
            }
            index++;
        }
        return count;
    }
