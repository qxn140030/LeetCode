You are given two strings word1 and word2. You want to construct a string merge in the following way: while either word1 or word2 are non-empty, choose one of the following options:
If word1 is non-empty, append the first character in word1 to merge and delete it from word1.
For example, if word1 = "abc" and merge = "dv", then after choosing this operation, word1 = "bc" and merge = "dva".
If word2 is non-empty, append the first character in word2 to merge and delete it from word2.
For example, if word2 = "abc" and merge = "", then after choosing this operation, word2 = "bc" and merge = "a".
Return the lexicographically largest merge you can construct.

A string a is lexicographically larger than a string b (of the same length) if in the first position where a and b differ, a has a character strictly larger than the corresponding character in b. 
For example, "abcd" is lexicographically larger than "abcc" because the first position they differ is at the fourth character, and d is greater than c.

Example 1:
Input: word1 = "cabaa", word2 = "bcaaa"
Output: "cbcabaaaaa"
Explanation: One way to get the lexicographically largest merge is:
- Take from word1: merge = "c", word1 = "abaa", word2 = "bcaaa"
- Take from word2: merge = "cb", word1 = "abaa", word2 = "caaa"
- Take from word2: merge = "cbc", word1 = "abaa", word2 = "aaa"
- Take from word1: merge = "cbca", word1 = "baa", word2 = "aaa"
- Take from word1: merge = "cbcab", word1 = "aa", word2 = "aaa"
- Append the remaining 5 a's from word1 and word2 at the end of merge.

Example 2:
Input: word1 = "abcabc", word2 = "abdcaba"
Output: "abdcabcabcaba"


public String largestMerge(String word1, String word2) {
    int n1 = word1.length(), n2 = word2.length();
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    int i = 0, j = 0;
    while (i < n1 && j < n2) {
        char c1 = word1.charAt(i), c2 = word2.charAt(j);
        if (c1 > c2) {
            sb.append(c1);
            i++;
        } else if (c2 > c1) {
            sb.append(c2);
            j++;
        } else {
            if (isGreater(word1, i, word2, j)) {
                sb.append(c1);
                i++;
            } else {
                sb.append(c2);
                j++;
            }
        }
    }
    if (i < n1) {
        sb.append(word1.substring(i));
    }
    if (j < n2) {
        sb.append(word2.substring(j));
    }
    return sb.toString();
}
boolean isGreater(String a, int i, String b, int j) {
    int n1 = a.length(), n2 = b.length();
    while (i < n1 && j < n2) {
        char c1 = a.charAt(i), c2 = b.charAt(j);
        if (c1 != c2) {
            return c1 > c2;
        }
        i++;
        j++;
    }
    return (n1 - i) >= (n2 - j);
