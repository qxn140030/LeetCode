The API: int read4(char *buf) reads 4 characters at a time from a file.
The return value is the actual number of characters read. For example, it returns 3 if there is only 3 characters left in the file.
By using the read4 API, implement the function int read(char *buf, int n) that reads n characters from the file.
Note:
The read function will only be called once for each test case.

Question: how does the memory work?
- Because of the physical implementation, loading 4 bytes in DDR is faster than to load 1 byte 4 times.
- On the majority of computers today, collection of 4 bytes, or 32 bits, is called a word.
  Most computer CPUs are optimized for the operations with words.

Approach 1: Use internal buffer of 4 characters
Time complexity: O(n) to copy n characters.
Space complexity: O(1) to keep tmp of 4 elements.
