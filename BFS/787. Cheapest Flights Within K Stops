There are n cities connected by some number of flights. You are given an array flights where flights[i] = [fromi, toi, pricei] indicates that there is a flight from city fromi to city toi with cost pricei.
You are also given three integers src, dst, and k, return the cheapest price from src to dst with at most k stops. If there is no such route, return -1.
Example 1:
Input: n = 4, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[2,0,100],[1,3,600],[2,3,200]], src = 0, dst = 3, k = 1
Output: 700
Explanation:
The graph is shown above.
The optimal path with at most 1 stop from city 0 to 3 is marked in red and has cost 100 + 600 = 700.
Note that the path through cities [0,1,2,3] is cheaper but is invalid because it uses 2 stops.

Example 2:
Input: n = 3, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]], src = 0, dst = 2, k = 1
Output: 200
Explanation:
The graph is shown above.
The optimal path with at most 1 stop from city 0 to 2 is marked in red and has cost 100 + 100 = 200.

Example 3:
Input: n = 3, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]], src = 0, dst = 2, k = 0
Output: 500
Explanation:
The graph is shown above.
The optimal path with no stops from city 0 to 2 is marked in red and has cost 500.

Approach 1: BFS
Time complexity: O(V + E * K)
Space complexity: O(V + E * K)

class Solution {
    public int findCheapestPrice(int n, int[][] flights, int src, int dst, int k) {
        Map<Integer, List<int[]>> adj = new HashMap<>();
        for (int[] f : flights) {
            adj.putIfAbsent(f[0], new ArrayList<>());
            adj.get(f[0]).add(new int[]{f[1], f[2]});
        }
        int[] dist = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(dist, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        Queue<int[]> q = new LinkedList<>();
        q.offer(new int[]{src, 0});
        int stops = 0;
        while (stops <= k && !q.isEmpty()) {
            int size = q.size();
            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                int[] cur = q.poll();
                int city = cur[0], distance = cur[1];
                if (adj.containsKey(city)) {
                    for (int[] e : adj.get(city)) {
                        int neighbour = e[0], price = e[1];
                        if (price + distance < dist[neighbour]) {
                            dist[neighbour] = price + distance;
                            q.offer(new int[]{neighbour, dist[neighbour]});
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
            stops++;
        }
        return dist[dst] == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? -1 : dist[dst];
    }

Approach 2: Dijkstra
Time complexity: O(V + E * K * log(E * K))
Space complexity: O(V + E * K)

            adj.putIfAbsent(f[0], new ArrayList<>());
            adj.get(f[0]).add(new int[]{f[1], f[2]});
        }
        int[] stops = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(stops, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        PriorityQueue<int[]> q = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]);
        q.offer(new int[]{0, src, 0});
        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            int size = q.size();
            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                int[] cur = q.poll();
                int dist = cur[0], city = cur[1], steps = cur[2];
                if (steps <= stops[city] && steps <= k + 1) {
                    stops[city] = steps;
                    if (city == dst) {
                        return dist;
                    }
                    if (adj.containsKey(city)) {
                        for (int[] e : adj.get(city)) {
                            q.offer(new int[]{dist + e[1], e[0], steps + 1});
                        }
                    }  
                }
