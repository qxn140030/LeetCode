Implement the following operations of a queue using stacks.
push(x) -- Push element x to the back of queue.
pop() -- Removes the element from in front of queue.
peek() -- Get the front element.
empty() -- Return whether the queue is empty.
Notes:
> You must use only standard operations of a stack -- which means only push to top, peek/pop from top, size, and is empty operations are valid. 
> Depending on your language, stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack by using a
list or deque (double-ended queue), as long as you use only standard operations of a stack.
You may assume that all operations are valid (for example, no pop or peek operations will be called on an empty queue).
Follow up:
Can you implement the queue such that each operation is amortized O(1) time complexity? 
In other words, performing n operations will take overall O(n) time even if one of those operations may take longer.

Approach 1: Two stacks
Push - O(n) per operation, Pop - O(1) per operation.

class MyQueue {
    Stack<Integer> s1;
    Stack<Integer> s2;
    public MyQueue() {
        s1 = new Stack<>();
        s2 = new Stack<>();
    }
    public void push(int x) {
        while (!s1.isEmpty()) {
            s2.push(s1.pop());
        }
        s1.push(x);
        while (!s2.isEmpty()) {
            s1.push(s2.pop());
        }
    }
    public int pop() {
        return s1.pop();
    }
    public int peek() {
        return s1.peek();
    }
    public boolean empty() {
        return s1.isEmpty();
    }
}

Approach 2: Two stacks
Push - O(1) per operation, Pop - Amortized O(1) per operation.

class MyQueue {
    Stack<Integer> s1;
    Stack<Integer> s2;
    int front;
    public MyQueue() {
        s1 = new Stack<>();
        s2 = new Stack<>();
    }
    public void push(int x) {
        if (s1.isEmpty()) {
            front = x;
        }
        s1.push(x);
    }
    public int pop() {
        if (s2.isEmpty()) {
            while (!s1.isEmpty()) {
                s2.push(s1.pop());
            }  
        }
        return s2.pop();
    }
    public int peek() {
        if (!s2.isEmpty()) {
            return s2.peek();
        }
        return front;
    }   
    public boolean empty() {
        return s1.isEmpty() && s2.isEmpty();
    }
}
