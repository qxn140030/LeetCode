Question: Given a string s and an integer k, reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string.
If there are fewer than k characters left, reverse all of them.
If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first k characters.

Example 1:
Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2
Output: "bacdfeg"

Example 2:
Input: s = "abcd", k = 2
Output: "bacd"

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(n)

class Solution {
    public String reverseStr(String s, int k) {
        char[] a = s.toCharArray();
        for (int start = 0; start < a.length; start += 2 * k) {
            int i = start;
            int j = Math.min(start + k - 1, a.length - 1);
            while (i < j) {
                char tmp = a[i];
                a[i++] = a[j];
                a[j--] = tmp;
            }
        }
        return new String(a);
    }
}
