Question: Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
    Note: Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

Bit manipulation. XOR will return 1 only on two different bits. If two numbers are the same, XOR will return 0. Finally only one left.
Time complexity: O(n). Space complexity: O(1).
 public class Solution {
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) {
            return -1;
        }
        int rst = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            rst ^= num;
        }
        return rst;
    }
}
