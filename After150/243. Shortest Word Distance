Given a list of words and two words word1 and word2, return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.
For example, Assume that words = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"].
Given word1 = “coding”, word2 = “practice”, return 3.
Given word1 = "makes", word2 = "coding", return 1.
Note:
You may assume that word1 does not equal to word2, and word1 and word2 are both in the list.

public class Solution {
    public int shortestDistance(String[] words, String word1, String word2) {
        int rst = words.length;
        int p1 = -1;
        int p2 = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
            if (words[i].equals(word1)) {
                p1 = i;
                if (p2 != -1) {
                    rst = Math.min(rst, Math.abs(p2 - p1));
                }
            } else if (words[i].equals(word2)) {
                p2 = i;
                if (p1 != -1) {
                    rst = Math.min(rst, Math.abs(p2 - p1));
                }
            }
        }
        return rst;
    }
}
