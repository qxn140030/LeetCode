You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the
only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and it will
automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.
Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money
you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

Time complexity: O(n). Space complexity: O(1).
public class Solution {
    public int rob(int[] nums) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        int local1 = 0;
        int local2 = nums[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int tmp = local1 + nums[i];
            local1 = Math.max(local1, local2);
            local2 = tmp;
        }
        return Math.max(local1, local2);
    }
}
