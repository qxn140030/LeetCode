Given an integer, write a function to determine if it is a power of three.

Could you do it without using any loop / recursion?

Solution 1: Loop iteration.
public class Solution {
    public boolean isPowerOfThree(int n) {
        if (n < 1) {
            return false;
        }
        while (n % 3 == 0) {
            n /= 3;
        }
        return n == 1;
    }
}

Solution 2: base conversion. regular expression.
convert the number to base 3 and check if it is written as a leading 1 followed by all 0.
A couple of built-in Java functions will help us along the way.
String baseChange = Integer.toString(number, base);
Time complexity: O(log3(n)). Space complexity: O(log3(n)).
public class Solution {
    public boolean isPowerOfThree(int n) {
        return Integer.toString(n, 3).matches("^10*$");
    }
}

Solution 3: Mathmatics. n = 3 ^ i. i = log3(n). i = logb(n) / lohb(3).
n is a power of three if and only if i is an integer. In Java, we check if a number is an integer by taking the decimal
part (using % 1) and checking if it is 0.
never use == when comparing double. 
because the result of Math.log10(n) / Math.log10(3) could be 5.0000001 or 4.9999999. 
public class Solution {
    public boolean isPowerOfThree(int n) {
        return Math.log10(n) / Math.log10(3) % 1 == 0;
    }
}
