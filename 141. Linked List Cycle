Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.
Follow up: 
Can you solve it without using extra space?

Solution 1: record each node's reference (or memory address) in a hash table.
Time complexity: O(n). visit each of the n elements in the list at most once. Adding a node to the hash table costs O(1) time.
Space complexity: O(n).
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) {
 *         val = x;
 *         next = null;
 *     }
 * }
 */
public class Solution {
    public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
        Set<ListNode> hs = new HashSet<ListNode>();
        while (head != null) {
            if (hs.contains(head)) {
                return true;
            } 
            hs.add(head);
            head = head.next;
        }
        return false;
    }
}

Solution 2: slow pointer moves one step at a time while the fast pointer moves two steps at a time. when both pointers are
in the cycle, it takes (distance between the 2 runners) / (difference of speed) loops for the fast runner to catch up with
the slow runner. 
time complexity: O(n). 
Space complexity: O(1). only use one node - fast.
public class Solution {
    public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
        ListNode fast = head;
        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            fast = fast.next.next;
            head = head.next;
            if (fast == head) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
